We visited this resort over Easter and found nothing to complain about, but then we were on holiday.

Rooms
This is an ECO resort, so they use low voltage lighting in the rooms making it quite dark but not impossibly dark. If you don't have towels or drinks in your fridge after the maid has been then she will come back later when she has them.

We visited this resort over Easter and found nothing to complain about, but then we were on holiday.

Rooms
This is an ECO resort, so they use low voltage lighting in the rooms making it quite dark but not impossibly dark. If you don't have towels or drinks in your fridge after the maid has been then she will come back later when she has them. It only took us a couple of days to work this out and why so obsessed with having a stocked fridge when it's all inclusive..you could always go and get a drink from the bar, oh wait, you'd have to walk there!
If your bed is hard, why not ask for a foam topper, ours already had one when we arrived, luck I guess.

Park next door
Xcaret has not been included for some time now, do your homework!!!! If your agency tells you it is, it is their fault not the hotels. Also, there is shade through the whole park, there's trees isn't there?? Yes it's a lot of walking, if you can't manage it well maybe you need to re-evaluate your life. Did you think it was going to be cool in Mexico, drink more water and wear a hat, even my 8 yr old could manage it. The "Trek" back to the park next door takes maybe 15 mins max from the heart of the park, too long for some I guess. What is with people who can't walk who have usable legs, I have painful knees, hips and back...still managed it.

Buffet
You have to wait to be seated except for breakfast. If you get there when it opens they may not have everything out yet, if you get there late don't expect everything to be red hot.
If you haven't got the patience to wait for your waiter to ask about drinks then go get them yourself. The food here was just great unless you expect that fancy stuff with <b>funny</b> sauces in pretty patterns all over it. There was fresh fruit every meal, maybe Mexico ran out of fruit for a week or maybe it didn't jump up and smack you in the face.....at breakfast there is a whole counter of fresh fruit. We asked for plain tuna one night for my daughter and after a while a chef brought out a whole bowl just for her. Is freshly carved meat so unacceptable. We saw some guy help himself to a whole chicken, very <b>funny</b>.

Internet
You don't need to have your own computer as stated below, they have 4 or 5 you can use in reception. If you do have your own, wi-fi can only be used in the lobby, not the rooms.

Service
Some of the bar staff were less than hospitable, but i don't care about their issues, i'm on holiday with my wonderful family and i don't go on holiday to be waited on....if we needed to actually stand up and walk to the bar then that's ok.

Safe
Worked fine. Once we needed help with it and help came. We left my netbook and cameras and DSI's out the whole two wks with no issues.

Shop
These are the most miserable people ever, I don't have hang-ups about being treated special so i can shrug it off. The tobacco shop sells medicine, if you get a poorly tummy why would you be telling your maid or concierge, lol. Go to the shop, get medicine like my hubby did and get on with it. My wonderful husband bless him, managed a whole day at Xplor after taking their meds. You're eating and drinking different stuff than you usually would, and you're in a different country. Do you think you're body wouldn't notice the change????

Water
We were told by our agent that all water and ice was bottled not tap water. I often got water from the bar with ice and was never ill. Why would you call reception to bring you water when you can (god forbid) walk to the bar and get it yourself.

Pools
Always full of leaves but cleaned EVERY day, admittedly the fun pool had an excessive amount of missing tiles, thats why we didn't use it. The swing bar pool is fab.

Elevators
Read on page four that there are no elevators. That's <b>funny</b> because we used them regularly and they were working and if they weren't and I couldn't get my luggage up to reception I would have asked.

There is a shuttle bus that will take you where you need to go, some irate woman in reception stopped me to ask me where she could get the bus to the beach, it's really not that far it's just finding the way. If you physically CAN'T walk, then why would you book here???? Oh by the way, the people in wheelchairs were having a ball.

Please remember that most of the negative reviews are from people who were unlucky enough to have probelms at the start and then have a negative attitude or just can't let it go. As for stolen cash, I would have called the police wouldn't you? It's Mexico for goodness sake, next time pay more and go somewhere else. We chose this hotel because it was a cheap base to explore from.

This was our first time on this side of the world, can't believe how some people moan about everything, they'll even moan about this review no doubt. I'd rather be on holiday with the Russians and If you've ever been to Egypt you'll know that that's saying a lot....

Have a great holiday it's fabulous here.

Just got back from the OGX and since I read reviews for weeks leading up to our trip I thought I'd return the favor. I really was well prepared for our trip thanks to some great reviews.

Just got back from the OGX and since I read reviews for weeks leading up to our trip I thought I'd return the favor. I really was well prepared for our trip thanks to some great reviews.
My husband and I stayed for five days and here are a list of things we liked:
---The lagoon is great. I heard a lot of complaining about this from other reviewers but while we were there the ocean was very rough and if it hadn't been for the lagoon we wouldn't have been able to swim much in the ocean. There were plenty of chairs (only chairs under trees by the pool had bird droppings it was NOT a problem as one reviewer had complained). A mask to use to snorkel in the lagoon is free for an hour and the tube is $4 and you keep it. Fish are by the rocks on the side of the lagoon and some people fed them to get them closer. It was nice to be able to snorkel while the rest of the family sunbathed close by. Sand was clean and lovely.
---The rocky shore was beautiful. No you won't be able to walk barefoot for miles up and down the beach but we found spectacular rock beaches that were more interesting than miles of sand. If you're facing the ocean in the lagoon area to the right is the beach buffet and to the left is a very natural area you can climb up some steps and see a ruin and wear some sandals (not flip flops) to go exploring the rocky area. The ocean was rough as I said so large waves crashed over the rocks filling some small sandy tidal pools and the whole thing was beautiful. We took several great photos just be careful the ocean spray doesn't get your camera wet as it did to one couple in our group.
---Pools were very clean. Yes some leaves may get into the water but that would be because there are trees by the pool in some places. Nothing that I even noticed. LOTS of places to sit by the pools, no problem finding a spot. I stayed in the shady areas most of the time and there was a constant breeze across the whole resort as well. Igaunas get so close. I saw some eating berries that had dropped from a tree by my lounge chair and we got a kick out of picking berries from the tree to feed them. They won't get close enough to touch you of course so while we love the wildlife if you don't then it's nothing to worry about. Keep track of your towels! They charge $50 for a lost towel and I saw plenty of abandoned towels by the lagoon one evening we were there. We got towels once and just hung them to dry at night so we wouldn't have to worry about needing a beach towel either before or after the towel hut closed.
---Air conditioning in the rooms is great. I had read this in some reviews and thought "so the air conditioner works big deal". But you'll notice even the air conditioned parts of the resort are a bit hot and humid. I take it that it's because the Mexicans are acclimated to the heat and don't keep the A/C on a low setting. So after a day of heat on the beach or in the pool and so so air conditioning in the shops and restaurants your cool room will be very welcome at the end of the day.
---Xcaret park we went to on a hot day and really didn't try to se everything because it would have been just too exhausting in the heat. We went on BOTH river swims which were FABULOUS. Upon arriving at the river swim entrance you will choose to either go left or right. There is no description of what to expect for either side. The left is a shallow river about 6' deep and is mostly out in the open yet shady. The water is beautiful and clear, we did not use snorkel gear. The right side is the way to go! Get some snorkel gear ($7 plus $20 deposit) and you will see some fish but several deep crevices and caverns beneath you. it was really interesting. The water is cool but will feel wonderful and you will float through in a life jacket. There is not much effort to moving through the river as it has a very slight current, go early in the day to avoid crowds. We went on a Sunday which we were told is a quieter day and it was not crowded at all. Sometimes the water will appear blurry through your mask. The is when the salt water and fresh water coming from the various underwater caves mix. The buffet is $29 so we didn't eat there. The men went into a bat cave and loved that. We also saw manatees, turtles, an aquarium. Some of our group went on a dolphin swim and said it was thrilling. I believe the dolphin swim was $139 a person and you have to make a reservation to do it back at the resort.

Things that were so/so:

---Food was rated either good, average or below average by the people in our group. I would say I am not a picky eater and it was average. Another couple we were with go to Mexico once a year at least and said it was good, compared to other resorts. Things that were good on the buffet were fish, vegetables and ice cream. I live in the midwest and am not a big fan of fish here. But fish there is so fresh it's delicious. They had a small selection of pasta and the sauce is very thin but I am comparing it to the absolutely spectacular Italian food we have here in St. Louis so there really is no comparison. There is plenty to choose from but after a few days you will most likely get sick of the buffet. The main buffet is near the lobby and the beach buffet is open for breakfast and lunch by the lagoon. We visited the concierge in our building to make our dinner reservations the day after we arrived (we should have done it the day of!) and only got into one restaurant the Senora Grill (steak). We got the tenderloin and it was very good. We had their white house wine which was also very good. Others in our group said the Oriental was fabulous and the Mexican was pretty good and the Italian was not great but OK. Good luck trying to get into the seafood restaurant by the beach called El Pescador. I heard it was fabulous but we weren't able to get in which was really disappointing to us. I think the reservations system is terrible. I don't know how it works but whatever they are doing ...it's not working. There is no room service. Late night food is either Pacos Tacos or the Pizzaria (both located by the main lobby), they are open alternately so whenever one is closed the other is open. Until 2 a.m. Someone in our group went and was told they were "out of food" at Pacos Tacos for the night at 1:45 am. We did not get sick, one person in our group of 15 had an upset stomach. Mine was a little upset when we got back. We attended a wedding and reception there and both were beautiful. The reception food was different than what they served everyday at the buffet but was buffet food nonetheless. The tables settings were beautiful and it was altogether very romantic. There were one or two other weddings there that same day so if you're getting married don't expect to be the only bride for the day.
---The room was less than what I expected. It's all tile, I am assuming there is no carpet because of the humidity, etc. but it just makes it that much more uncomfortable. We had a regular room which is called a "deluxe room". We asked for a king bed in our reservation and got two beds. My cousin and her friend had asked for one room with two beds and got one king so we just switched. But if we hadn't been able to switch it would have been REALLY ANNOYING to have to walk all the way back to the lobby, get the luggage taken somewhere else and spend an hour dealing with this when all you'll want to do when you arrive is settle in, eat and swim or go exploring. There probably is nothing a person can do to prevent this so just don't get you're heart set on the check in process going perfect. Everything worked in our room but others in our group had safe's that didn't work, a ceiling fan that didn't work, a remote that didn't work, light bulbs burnt out, one couple had a door that no one could get unlocked, our key cards suddenly stopped working after two days (which the front desk guy attributed to them being placed to close to electronics so be careful). The TV was much smaller than the cabinet it was in was designed for and there were three english speaking channels (one is cartoon network for the kiddies) but we only watched TV before falling asleep so whatever was on in English was fine by us...usually it was Rescue 911 and shows about dinosaurs and Seinfeld.

Things we did not like:

---The beds! They are like sleeping on a floor. I asked other travelers who claimed all the resorts have hard beds since that seems to be what Europeans like. Well I hated it!! Maybe because I'm American. I woke up every morning so stiff and when I asked for a foam topper (try communicating THAT to people who speak English as a 2nd language) I was told they were all out. Gee I wonder why... Someone did come and put two quilts under our sheets but it didn't make any difference. No one else in our group really had a hard time with it as much as I did. I just didn't sleep well the entire time. I am almost positive someone in our group that got bites all over her leg had gotten them from bedbugs.
---Our outing called the "ocean safari". My husband wanted to rent a sea-doo jet ski while we were there. I was less than enthused by the idea but I figured may as well try to be adventurous for his sake. So we paid $182 (or $91 per person) for a two hour sea-doo/snorkel trip. First off when they say you get picked up in the lobby what they really mean is you need to go to the very front of the lobby and down some stairs to the shelter in the parking lot to wait for your shuttle. There is a sign in the lobby that points to the steps and says "tour pick up" or something like that. We got there and got on our sea-doo and what a nightmare! I screamed the entire time. My body kept flying into the air, I was holding on for dear life, my swimming suit bottom quickly became a G-string and there was nothing I could do about it because I was holding on, we were trying to keep up with the guide (everyone follows the guide in a single file line) thank God we were the last in the line so no one would see my butt. We fell off twice. So much salt water splashed into my husband's face that he threw up in the ocean. It is <b>funny</b> thinking back on it now but sucked at the time. I think we were naive in thinking that it would be like taking a sea-doo on a lake back here at home. Then we got off the sea-doo and snorkeled which was really great I must admit THAT was fun. Then we got back on for another 30 minutes of not having fun on the sea-doo. We should have just taken a boat out and snorkeled that way. The next day my thighs were so sore I walked <b>funny</b>, my husband's thighs were chafed so he walked <b>funny</b> and we both had bruises on our legs. Another couple much older than us did the same trip and said it was fun. So it's all a matter of perspective...I guess. Four days later my legs are STILL sore!

Don't forget to bring:

---Super powerful sunscreen. I got SPF 85 (made by nuetrogena). I am fair and a redhead. I DO tan but I also wanted to avoid being miserable for the entire trip because of a sunburn. The rays are MUCH stronger there than they are here in Missouri. Everyone laughed at my 85 SPF but I still got sunburned!! And am very tan now. I should have brought a shirt to wear at least while I was snorkeling and not worried about looking cute.
--painkillers for your hangover (or sore thighs!), Immodium in case Montezuma takes his revenge on you. bug spray if you get bitten easily although mosquitos and fluing insects seemed non-existent.
--About $100-150 in ones for tips.
--You won't wear much more than a swimsuit and cover up during the day so bring several.
--If you need more than 15 hangers for your clothes then bring some of your own.

A quick information about us: My husband and I are childfree and this is our 5th time in Mexico. Saving for trips is part of our budget and we do travel at least once or twice a year. We have been to Europe, Middle East, Asia and have tried a cruise once.

A quick information about us: My husband and I are childfree and this is our 5th time in Mexico. Saving for trips is part of our budget and we do travel at least once or twice a year. We have been to Europe, Middle East, Asia and have tried a cruise once.

First and Only Caveat: If you are a beach lover (ie. long walks on the beach, sunrise and sunset by the beach), please note that this resort is not for you and do not bother reading the succeeding paragraphs.

Location: It is a bit far from the airport. It took us 1 hour and 30 minutes to get to the resort. Mind you, the bus has to stop in 5 resorts and we were the 3rd resort. In all our trips to Mexico, we have always relied on hotel bus pickup (never took a cab even though it was an option). Why? We feel that we are on vacation and we just wanted to be carted from airport to resort and back. We have all the time in the world!

Room: We arrived at 10 am and room was not ready till 3pm, as promised. We were fine with that. Had a good lunch then hang around by the pool. We were part of the Sunquest package (Deluxe Room, free tequila, fruit plate, bathrobe). Location is as we have requested. Ground floor; 20 steps away to the `quiet pool` (Bldg. 17). Outside our room is also the ice machine and water cooler filter (very convenient!) However, we got two double beds (we requested for King or Queen) but this is no biggie for us because we like to put our suitcase and other stuff on the other bed.

Service in Restaurants: Excellent! These people work really, really hard. All the staff were constantly in motion! They really try to please the guests. It is also worthy to point out that I have never felt compelled to tip (although we did tip a lot and often!). My husband and I had visited countries in the past where the locals were constantly (and blatantly) hounding tourist for tips. I have never felt this way in Mexico and, again, this is our 5th time! They seem to provide good service out of the goodness of their heart.

We took advantage of the alloted Ala Carte and they are: El Pescador, Sonora, Mediterranean and the Oriental. They were all excellent but we were not too pleased with the Oriental. The service is very good but it is the presentation and quality of food that disappointed us. It lacked the typical Japanese elegance and quality of presentation. They put soy sauce on Sushi right off the bat (as supposed to having a separate dish for the guest to dip the sauce themselves). I also do not think that they use rolling mat for the sushi. Instead, they just shape it by their hands and one of my Ebi Sushi was not in proper shape that the rice was almost falling off. I ordered 'Teppanyaki' as main course which, in reality, has to be cooked and presented in front the guests showcasing the talent of the Chef. It was not like that at all. They cooked it in the kitchen (which I had gladly accepted after inquiring) but then the food turned out to be like another 'stir fry'.

We love `The Buffet`. It has enough variety for both me and my husband to enjoy. Please note that my husband is a fussy eater and he does not eat seafood.

There is something <b>funny</b> though about the restaurants and mind you, this is not a big issue for us - I just thought I will mention. It appears that `teaspoons` are in short supply. Basically, guests tend to use serving spoon for stirring coffee and eating desserts (ie: ice cream). I find it rather <b>funny</b> using my gigantic serving spoon to stir my coffee. But no big deal. I just flip the giant spoon upside down and use the handle instead to stir! We realize later on that teaspoons are quite present on the dining table at Ala Carte Restaurants - so that`s where they are!

Xcaret Eco-Park: As you know, we are allowed a day trip at Eco-Park. This park had exceeded my expectation. They really looked after their animals. Their exhibits are at par in what I have seen in North America. They spent quite a bit to built the sanctuary for the jaguars and tigers! The walk around the Butterfly Exhibit was quite an experience for me. It was amazing to see different sizes of butterflies roaming around in riot of colours! I had a few photographs where a butterfly was perched on my finger! And the Xcaret Show in the evening, do not miss it! I enjoyed seeing the actual demonstration of their ancient sport. However, please note that it is 2 hours so be prepared. Benches have cushioned seats though so it is not that bad.

The lobby was amazing even just to stroll around. In fact on our first night strolling around the man-made river flowing around the lobby, I suddenly remember my visit in Venice. Not the same scale but enough to trigger a fond memory.

Overall, it is a well run hotel. The staff is great. Yes, it is not perfect but hey, as the saying goes, we create our own experience. And yes, I will recommend this resort to friends (but not to those friends who love the beach).

If you are a 'gym rat' like us, please note that the resort has a gym. It has 4 treadmills and 2 Elliptical Machines. Try to come early as these machines tend to get busy. There are free weighs and other exercise machine so if you have your own routine, you can do it there.

And before I end -- those photographers who roam around the resort to take pictures of you with the animals (ie: parrots, Igor the Iguana) - please note that they take GREAT pictures but they are US$15 each...just be aware of that before you strike a pose that would offer you 25 amazing pictures to choose from! They do add up after a few poses!

The pool was old and paint was peeling off everywhere. The sporting goods the staff supplied were old and quite a bit beat up. The drinks were weak and soda pop was <b>funny</b> tasting. The entertainment was strange and I didn't find the comedy at all <b>funny</b>. The show was in an outdoor theater and we had to sit on the concrete steps.

We stayed from 28th March to 11th April 2007. Had read some reviews and wondered what it would really be like. Don't know what some people expect. This hotel is fantastic, brilliant, big, great marvelous!! (As you can tell we liked it) We went there with our 9/10 year old daughter whose birthday it was on the 1st April.

We stayed from 28th March to 11th April 2007. Had read some reviews and wondered what it would really be like. Don't know what some people expect. This hotel is fantastic, brilliant, big, great marvelous!! (As you can tell we liked it) We went there with our 9/10 year old daughter whose birthday it was on the 1st April. The staff in the Oriental restaurant had been told it was her birthday and a cake had been made with 'Happy Birthday Zoe' iced on the top. All the people joined in singing Happy BIrthday and really made her day. As we said, this hotel is on a big scale but that is part of the holiday. Where else can you go where they have to give you a map so you can find your way round. Most of the paths take you through bits of the jungle and beautifully maintained gardens. All the staff are really friendly and always say 'Halo' (pronounced 'ola') even the security people who go whizzing passed you on their bikes.

The hotel grounds are home to Monkey's, Deer, Flamingo's, Iguana's and the parrots in the lobby are very <b>funny</b>. One got stuck up a tree as was screeching for help!! The lobby area is amazing. Have never seen such a massive lobby with a lake, fish, fountain and trees in it.

Now to the food. All of us have come back slightly heavier than we went. So much choice, always hot and they have different themed evenings every day. The Al-la-Carte restauraunts are nice but one advice would be try to book 3 or 4 days in advance as they do tend to get booked up quite quickly but we did always get in even though maybe not at our prefered time.

The pool areas are great. One pool is quiet and the other ones are were theres a lot more going on. The 'Fun Club' team are really great and will soon have you joining in anygame they can think up along with the usuall water Volleyball, Salsa dance lessons etc. Waiters are always walking round so you don't even have to get of your sun lounger if you want a drink.

The room was imaculate and very comfortable even with 3 of us in it. Our room had a balcony with lovely views in both directions.

We did 4 trips and all were well worth it. The best being the trip to Puerto Aventures to swim with the Dolphins, Manatees and play with Karla the very <b>funny</b> sealion!!! Great for kids and big kids like us. and then had a catamaran trip in the afternoon were we got to snorkel over the coral reef with is brilliant.

Overall we wish we could go back tomorrow. Absolutely fabulous hotel. Make sure you go and make your own mind up.
